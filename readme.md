# Real Estate Data Scraper

### Overview

This project contains a Python script that automates the process of downloading real estate tax data from a specific county tax website and extracting detailed property information from the target property appraiser website based on unpaid taxes. The script is divided into two main parts:

1. **Downloading the CSV file**: 
   - The script navigates to the real estate reports page on the county tax website, selects the desired report (unpaid taxes), filters by a specific tax year, and downloads the corresponding CSV file.
   - The CSV file is saved in a directory named `TD_files` within the current working directory.

2. **Extracting property data**:
   - The script reads the downloaded CSV file, drop unnecessary columns, iterates through the records, and for each property, it retrieves detailed information such as the ownerâ€™s name, property address, and additional property details from the target website.
   - The extracted information is then appended to the DataFrame and saved as a new CSV file named `unpaid_taxes.csv`.

### Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**
- **Pandas**
- **chromedriver_autoinstaller**

### Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x:** Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. **Install Required Libraries:** Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium pandas chromedriver-autoinstaller
    ```
3. **Clone the Repository:** Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage

1. **Set the Tax Year**:
   - Modify the `tax_year_input` variable at the beginning of the script to specify the desired tax year for which the CSV file should be downloaded.

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python real_estate.py
    ```

3. **Output**:
   - The final output will be a CSV file containing the original data along with additional property details such as owner name, property address, year built, living area, etc.


## Customization

- **Target Year**: 
  - Change the `tax_year_input` variable to download data for different tax years.
  
- **Additional Data Fields**:
  - Modify the code to extract and include more data fields as needed.

## Notes

- Ensure that the website's structure or elements haven't changed. If the website updates, you might need to adjust the XPaths or CSS selectors used in the script.
- The script currently waits for 30 seconds before performing certain actions. This can be adjusted depending on your network speed and website response time.
